# MODELING_AND_CONTROL_OF_QUADCOPTER_SUBJECT_TO_TURBLENCE
A 3d quadcopter simulator  (Matlab/Simulink)

The PDF file contains the design of non-linear controllers (Backstepping - Feedback Linearization) applied to a mathematical model of a quadcopter in order to have a stable and robust behavior with respect to disturbances (ground effect).

+The 3D simulator made by Matlab/Simulink will be provided soon :).
